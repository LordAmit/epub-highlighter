# Epub Words Highlighter

Epub Words Highlighter highlights all the words from a provided list of words. Give it a epub file (test/test.epub) and a file (list) containing list of words, and it will make them ***bold and italic*** for you in all the chapters, all the paragraphs. What's more, it will even make those ***CAPS*** so that you do not miss them by any chancce!

Why? This will probably be useful for English Proficiency Test Participants, like GRE, IELTS and so on.

(This will probably not be supported in near or distant future. I created it on a whim as a weekend pet project with no particular ambition. If you want to fork and improve it - by all means, go for it!)

After the first day he had no curiosity at all. To break the monotony he invented games. Death to all modifiers, he declared one day, and out of every letter that passed through his hands went every adverb and every adjective. The next day he made war on articles. He reached a much higher plane of creativity the following day when he blacked out everything in the letters but a, an and the. That erected more dynamic intralinear tensions, he felt, and in just about every case left a message far more universal. Soon he was proscribing parts of salutations and signatures and leaving the text untouched. One time he blacked out all but the salutation 'Dear Mary' from a letter, and at the bottom he wrote, 'I yearn for you tragically. R. O. Shipman, Chaplain, U.S. Army.'
