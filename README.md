# Epub Words Highlighter

Epub Words Highlighter highlights all the words from a provided list of words. Give it a epub file (test/test.epub) and a file (list) containing list of words, and it will make them ***bold and italic*** for you in all the chapters, all the paragraphs.

Why? This will probably be useful for English Proficiency Test Participants, like GRE, IELTS and so on.

(This will probably not be supported in near or distant future. I created it on a whim as a weekend pet project with no particular ambition. If you want to fork and improve it - by all means, go for it!)
